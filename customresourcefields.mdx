title: "Custom Resource Fields"
---
Often, the fields listed above aren't sufficient to document resources. You may want to record a set of specific parameters in a standardized way across different assets. The walkthrough below covers the process of creating custom fields. Finally, a similar process is available to document specific parameters of [Instances](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betanetworks#custom-instance-fields).

*This process can be automated with our API coming mid-March 2023.*
