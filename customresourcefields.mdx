title: "Custom Resource Fields"
---
Artemis allows you to create custom fields to document facets of your Resources that aren’t covered by the standard Resource framework. 

This feature exists to let you record parameters used when your Resources are used to diagram out your projects on the Network. For example, you may have a script with five variable parameters. You should create five custom fields. This enables you to document which parameters were in play when you document an Instance of your script. 

<Card title="What are Instances?">
If you haven’t already learned about Instances, this may be confusing. Artemis lets you document your Resources in the Catalog then diagram your projects on the Network to show you these Resources are used. Each time a Resource appears on the Network is called an Instance of that Resource.
