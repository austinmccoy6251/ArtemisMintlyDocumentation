title: "Custom Resource Fields"
---
Artemis allows you to create custom fields to document facets of your Resources that aren’t covered by the standard Resource framework.

Most commonly, users create fields to capture parameters used when Resources are used. 

Every time you place a Resource on a Network you’ll probably want to record exactly how it was configured/run in that Instance. Custom fields lets you create space to do that (and our [API](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/api) lets you autofill your parameters into Artemis direct from your code).

<Card title="What are Instances?">
Every time you place a Resource on a Network is an “Instance” of that Resource. When you create an Instance, you’re encouraged to record documentation that explain how the Resource was used in context. This means every Instance of a Resource will be based on the same thing (and linked to the original) but slightly different.
