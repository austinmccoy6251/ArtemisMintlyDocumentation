The Command Bar should be one of your best friends as you learn to navigate Artemis. At any time, you can **access the Command Bar by pressing CTRL + K**. When you do, a window like the one below will appear. 

Youâ€™ll see a bar and a list of auto-populated options that display docs and walkthroghs relevant to whichever screen you are on when you press CTRL + K.
