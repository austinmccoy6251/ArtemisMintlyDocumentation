The three main pillars of Artemis are the resource catalog, instance network and instance archive. These smaller, supplementary tools are deigned to help you navigate the main three more effectively. 

## Pipelines

## Finder
The finder is a superpowered search bar. It can be found on the left-hand sidebar at the organizational, workspace and project levels (not subproject). It can be used to find anything contained inside the level you’re at. For example, the finder accessed from the organizational level lets you search for workspaces, projects, subprojects, pipelines, resources and instances. By this same token, accessing the finder at the project level only lets you search things that can be inside projects: resources, pipelines and instances.
In brief, the finder lets you find things inside whatever level of organization you’re at.

## Event logs
Event logs automatically track and report the history of various spaces. It can be found on the left-hand sidebar at any level. Accessing the log at the project level reports the history of that project. Clicking into the log for a workspace displays the history of that workspace – and so on. 

## Comments
Comments function like event logs only they display user generated comments instead of system-generated reports of events.

## Trash
When you’re looking at your list of workspaces, projects, subprojects, instances or resources you’ll notice a toggle switch at the upper right hand corner that says “trash.” Actuating this switch reveals deleted versions of whatever you’re looking at.

Note: if you’ve deleted something that contains other things, like a workspace, you need to restore the resource before you enter it. You cannot browse the content of deleted things before restoring them.
