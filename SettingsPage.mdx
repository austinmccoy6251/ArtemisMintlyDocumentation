2.	Creating custom Resource types 
3.	Creating status tags
4.	Accessing your API key

### Adding users to your Roster
Before you add users to your Workspace, you need to make sure they’re on your organization’s Roster. Users are added to your Roster by email – you enter the address associated with their Artemis account.

Adding someone to your Roster by email is a one-time step. Once a user is in your Roster they can be added to Workspaces, Projects and Subprojects by name.

The walkthrough on [this page](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betaWorkspaces) shows you how to add a user to your Roster. 

### Creating custom Resource types
Artemis comes pre-populated with some of the most common Resource types, but it’s probable you’ll need to create your own. [This is a link to a page that covers Resource types in-depth.]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/customresourcetypes)

### Creating status tags
Status tags can be assigned to [Modules]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/modulesintro) and [Pipelines](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/PipelinesIntro) to indicate where they are in your workflow. This is totally optional, we’ve just found some users like to label different modules and pipelines with tags like “experimental” or “in production” for the benefit of their team.

Tags are created in Settings, you can see the exact location highlighted in step three of the walkthrough above. 

### Accessing your API key

The API key is needed to make any API requests. Step eight of the walkthrough found above shows you where you can find it. 

Here’s a [link to our fill API documentation](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/api).
