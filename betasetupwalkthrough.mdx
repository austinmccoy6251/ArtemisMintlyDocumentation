This four-part guide walks you through the process of setting up your first Project and documenting some Resources involved. This guide covers nearly every aspect of Artemis from a high level. Check out subsequent sections of our docs for detailed breakdowns.

<Accordion title="Artemis Structure">
  Artemis lets you create Workspaces for your teams. You can think of Workspaces as departments of an office where team members who coordinate together on multiple projects can be placed.

Workspaces contain Projects. Each Project can be sub-devided into as many Subprojects as you need. 

Subprojects are where the real work takes place. Each one contains a Resource Catalog to document every asset brought to bear and Modules that let you diagram how each Resource is related.

Here's a  diagram that represents this structure:

  <Accordion title="Create a Workspace, Project and Module">
The first thing you need to do is add users to your organization. You'll need to ask each user for their ID Number. Once they're in your organization's roster they can be added by name to Workspaces, Projects and Subprojects.

Next we're going to create a Workspace and place a Project inside it. You can think of Workspaces as departments in an office. If you have a group of people who will coordinate together on many Projects, you should put them together in a Workspace.

Finally, enter the Project and create a Subproject inside of it. Subprojects are where the action happens. Check out this section of our docs for details.

<Accordion title="Create Resources">
Inside your **Subproject** you’ll find a **Resource Catalog** where your team can document all the assets brought to bear on whatever they’re working on.

<Accordion title="Place Instances on Network">
**Networks** are spaces to diagram how your resources relate in a given Project. They let you gain a 30,000 foot view of a team’s work in seconds. 
  
To create a Network inside your Subproject, enter the **Modules** tab and press **New Module** at the top right. 

<Frame caption="Creating a new Module">

</Frame>

Name your Module, create it and a modal like the one below will appear. **Click the second tab** that looks like a network and you’ll see a blank canvas to work with.

<Frame caption="A blank Network inside a Module">
  <img src="https://d27n7fycrsusaz.cloudfront.net/blank+netowkr.JPG" />
</Frame>
  
At the top of the Network there’s a button to place a **New Instance**. Each time a Resource is added to a Network to diagram how it’s used, that’s called an Instance of that Resource. Press the **New Instance** button at the top of the Network, hover your cursor over where you want it to be and **right click** to place your Instance. 
  
A Module like the one below will appear prompting you to name the Instance and indicate which Resource it’s an example of. You do this by opening another tab with the **Resource Catalog**, clicking the Resource you’re working with and **copying the Resource ID**. Paste it into the modal to create an Instance.
  
<Frame caption="Creating an Instance">

</Frame>
  
Once you create your Instance, it will appear on the network. Consult [this guide](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/detailed-breakdowns/Instnetwork) or 5:50 at the video below to learn how to document the relationships between various instances.
