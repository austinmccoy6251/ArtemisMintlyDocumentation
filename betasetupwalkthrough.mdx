This four-part guide walks you through the process of setting up your first Project and documenting some Resources involved. This guide covers nearly every aspect of Artemis from a high level. Check out subsequent sections of our docs for detailed breakdowns.

<Accordion title="Artemis Structure">
  Artemis lets you create Workspaces for your teams. You can think of Workspaces as departments of an office where team members who coordinate together on multiple projects can be placed.

Workspaces contain Projects. Each Project can be sub-devided into as many Subprojects as you need. 

Subprojects are where the real work takes place. Each one contains a Resource Catalog to document every asset brought to bear and Modules that let you diagram how each Resource is related.

Here's a  diagram that represents this structure:

  <Accordion title="Create a Workspace, Project and Module">
The first thing you need to do is add users to your organization. You'll need to ask each user for their ID Number. Once they're in your organization's roster they can be added by name to Workspaces, Projects and Subprojects.

Next we're going to create a Workspace and place a Project inside it. You can think of Workspaces as departments in an office. If you have a group of people who will coordinate together on many Projects, you should put them together in a Workspace.

Finally, enter the Project and create a Subproject inside of it. Subprojects are where the action happens. Check out [this section](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/BetaSubprojects) of our docs for details.

<Accordion title="Create Resources">
Inside your **Subproject** you’ll find a **Resource Catalog** where your team can document all the assets brought to bear on whatever they’re working on.

<Accordion title="Place Instances on Network">
Networks are spaces to diagram how your resources relate in a given Project. They let you gain a 30,000 foot view of a team’s work in seconds. Networks are housed inside Modules. From within your Subproject, click the Moduels tab, press "New Module," name and create it. Then enter the Module and click the Network icon (second tab). 

You will encounter a blank network. You can fill it with Instances to diagram your work. Every time you use a Resource in your work, we call that an Instance. Check out the walkthrough below to learn about creating Instances. Check out the full documentation on Instances and the network [here](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betanetworks).

Once you place Instances, you need to connect them. Here's a walkthrough that explains that process:
