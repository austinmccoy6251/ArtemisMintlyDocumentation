This guide will walk you through setting up and running your first project in Artemis. 

Primarily, it will introduce you to the way Artemis lets you structure your team and organize the projects they work on. Inside your organization, Artemis lets you create different groups of people by assigning them to “**Workspaces**.” 

Each Workspace can host a practically unlimited number of “**Projects**.” 

Each Project contains "**Subprojects**" to help teams deal with each effort’s component parts. 

Finally, each Subproject contains **"Resource Catalogs" and "Modules"** to help you organize the pertinent data science assets.


Here's a  diagram that represents this structure:

### Step by Step Walkthrough 
Most the steps involved with creating Workspaces, Projects and Subprojects are intuitive, but here’s a reference guide in case you should need it. 
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create a Workspace, Project and Module">
First you need to **add users to your Organization**. Do this by clicking the **Settings** tab on the left side of your screen. Then click **Users** and **Add User**.
    
When you first add a user to your Org you'll need to ask them for their ID Number. After they're in your Org you can add them to Workspaces, Projects, etc. by name because they'll appear in your roster.

Next, **create a Workspace** by pressing the green **New Workspace** button on the home page of your Org.

</Frame>
    
Name your workspace when prompted, enter the workspace and **add users to your Workspace** using the Users tab that appears on the left side of your screen. You will not need users’ ID Numbers here. Instead, you’ll see a selectable list of the users you’ve already added to your Org.

</Frame>
    
**Create a Project** inside your Workspace by clicking the **Projects** tab and selecting **New Project** button in the upper right hand corner. Populate your Project with users.

Finally, entery your Project, click the **Subprojects tab** to **Create a Subproject** and add users to it as well.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Create Resources">
Inside your **Subproject** you’ll find a **Resource Catalog** where your team can document all the assets brought to bear on whatever they’re working on. 
  
To add a Resource, enter the Catalog and push the green **New Resource** button at the top right. 
  
<Frame caption="Creating a new Resource">
  <img src="https://d27n7fycrsusaz.cloudfront.net/new+resource+1+2.JPG" />
</Frame>
  
A modal will appear prompting you to **name the Resource**. When you press the green **Create Resource** button, it will be added to your Catalog and another modal will appear giving you the chance to add more documentary content to the resource’s Catalog entry. 
  
Here’s an [in-depth guide](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/detailed-breakdowns/resourcecatalog) on how to document Resources in the Catalog. 
  
<Frame caption="This is the modal you'll use to name your new Resource">

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Place Instances on Network">
**Networks** are spaces to diagram how your resources relate in a given Project. They let you gain a 30,000 foot view of a team’s work in seconds. 
  
To create a Network inside your Subproject, enter the **Modules** tab and press **New Module** at the top right. 

<Frame caption="Creating a new Module">
  <img src="https://d27n7fycrsusaz.cloudfront.net/new+mod.JPG" />
</Frame>

Name your Module, create it and a modal like the one below will appear. **Click the second tab** that looks like a network and you’ll see a blank canvas to work with.

<Frame caption="A blank Network inside a Module">

</Frame>
  
At the top of the Network there’s a button to place a **New Instance**. Each time a Resource is added to a Network to diagram how it’s used, that’s called an Instance of that Resource. Press the **New Instance** button at the top of the Network, hover your cursor over where you want it to be and **right click** to place your Instance. 
  
A Module like the one below will appear prompting you to name the Instance and indicate which Resource it’s an example of. You do this by opening another tab with the **Resource Catalog**, clicking the Resource you’re working with and **copying the Resource ID**. Paste it into the modal to create an Instance.
  
<Frame caption="Creating an Instance">
  <img src="https://d27n7fycrsusaz.cloudfront.net/create+instance.JPG" />
</Frame>
  
Once you create your Instance, it will appear on the network. Consult [this guide](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/detailed-breakdowns/Instnetwork) or 5:50 at the video below to learn how to document the relationships between various instances.
