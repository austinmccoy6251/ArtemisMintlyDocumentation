title: "Documenting Parameters"
---
After you document that you ran your Pipeline you should document what exactly made that run unique. Artemis lets you do this in just a few steps. 

First, be sure you’ve set up the parameters you’re going to document for each Pipeline step. Do this by double clicking a step on the Pipeline, navigating to the fields tab (third from bottom on the left hand bar) and pressing the “Add Field” button. 

Now when you make a new run of your Pipeline you can fill in the appropriate values for each of these fields. This is a manual task that can be automated by use of our API.

<Card title="PLEASE NOTE:">
  Once you’ve created a field you cannot change its name. Also, note that you cannot delete fields unless you’ve cleared all the data from them on every run. This is designed to help protect against accidental data loss.

### Walkthrough
The walkthrough below demonstrates how to set up custom fields to record parameters, run the pipeline and document what we changed each run. 

This example is a continuation of the small pipeline we made above. The parameters we’re documenting are the day the database was last updated and the location of the output CSV file.
