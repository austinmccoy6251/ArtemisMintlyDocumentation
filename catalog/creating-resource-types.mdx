title: "Creating Resource Types"

  "Artemis comes pre-populated with a few resource type options like script,
  database and model but it's probable that your team will want to document and
  manage more than these."

To create a new resource type select "Settings" on the sidebar menu and opt to
"Add Type." This will present the option to set the name, icon and other
properties of your new type. This type will be available across every workspace.
