title: "Using Pipelines"
---
Artemis make it easy to record when your Pipeline was run and what parameters were used for each run. This section covers how that works, building on the small example Pipeline we created in the last section, [Constructing Pipelines]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/ConstructingPipelines).

The next two pages cover: 
1.	Creating new runs of a Pipeline
2.	Documenting the unique circumstances of each run
