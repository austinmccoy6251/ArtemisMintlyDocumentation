title: "Running Pipelines"
---
The following walkthrough demonstrates the mechanics of setting up a Pipeline. By “setting up” we mean the process of diagraming how it’s laid out. The next section of our docs explain how to document runs, their parameters and results. 

Artemis make it easy to record when your Pipeline was run and what parameters were used for each run. This section covers how that works, building on the small example Pipeline we created in the last section, [Constructing Pipelines]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/ConstructingPipelines).

This page will cover: 
1.	Creating new runs of a Pipeline
2.	Documenting the unique circumstances of each run 
### Making new runs
This is very easy. Simply enter your Pipeline, click the icon of a man running and press the green “Add Run” button. The run will appear on the Pipeline Runs section of your Pipeline page.
The walkthrough below demonstrates this procedure:
