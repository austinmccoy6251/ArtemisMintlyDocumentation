The Resource Catalog is one place for an entire team to document what assets they're bringing to bear on their work. Adding to the Catalog is quick and easy:

The video above gives a high level overview of a few tools we’ll now take a closer look at:

* **Main Tab:** The main tab displays the resource name, its ID number and a handful of other useful datapoints about the asset.

* **Resource Content:** This tab is a place to store information about the location of your resource. For example, if you’re documenting a script this is likely a GitHub link.

* **Comments:** This is where members of your team can leave notes about a resource. These are public to everybody who visits the resource – not direct messages to its creator!

* **History:** Every time a resource is edited in any way or an instance is generated of it a new “event” will be logged on its history tab. You can also manually add custom events here.

* **Instances:** This tab lets you view all the instances of this resource in one place.

* **Settings:** The primary function of this tab is to change who has edit privileges for this resource.
