Resources are created inside the Catalog. This page first offers a walkthrough that explains how to make a Resource. Next you’ll find a breakdown of every tab inside Resources and their functionality. Finally, there’s a quick section on Folders and how they work in the Catalog.

### Default Fields
When you enter a Resource you will see seven tabs, as represented in the image below. This quick-reference guide walks you through each of them.

A breakdown of each tab inside a Resource, in order of appearance: 
- **Main Tab:** Contains core information about the Resource like its unique ID number, creator, name, etc. Pressing the green “Edit Details" button allows you to add notes that will appear in this tab, change the Resource’s type and make it searchable/non-searchable in the [Finder]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/finder). 
<br />
- **Content Tab:** Contains a fillable field where you can enter a link to your Resource or a description of where it’s hosted. For example, if you’re documenting a script this may be a GitHub link. 
<br />
- **Comments:** Any user authorized to view your Resource can add comments to it here viewable by all other authorized users. 
<br />
- **History:** This is an auto-generated history of the Resource that logs everything that happens to/with it. You can manually add history events by pressing the green “Add Event” button. 
<br />
- **Resource Usage:** This tab displays a list of every time the Resource is placed on a [Network]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betanetworks) or as a [Pipeline]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/PipelinesIntro) step.
<br />
- **Custom Fields:** You can create your own custom fields here. This is most often used to document Parameters when a script is run as part of a Network. [More on that here]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/documentinginstances).
<br />
- **Settings:** The settings tab is where you can authorize other users to edit your Resource. 

### Folders
In the Resource Catalog there’s a green button you can use to create a new folder. Folders will appear in your Catalog alongside your Resources. To move a Resource into a folder, CTRL + Click the Resource(s) you’re trying to move. Without releasing CTRL, select the folder. 

A button that says “Move Content” will appear at the top of the window. Press it and the selected Resource(s) will be transported into the folder.
