title: "Creating Resources"
---
Resources are created inside the Catalog. The process is mostly self-explanatory and is demonstrated in the walkthrough below. Below that is a quick reference guide that outlines the default fields that appear inside each Resource to help you record the most important types of metadata. 

### Walkthrough
This walkthrough demonstrates how to enter a Resource Catalog and create a Resource.

### Default Fields
When you enter a Resource you will see seven tabs, as represented in the image below. This quick-reference guide walks you through each of them.

A breakdown of each tab inside a Resource, in order of appearance: 
- **Main Tab:** Contains core information about the Resource like its unique ID number, creator, name, etc. Pressing the green “Edit Details" button allows you to add notes that will appear in this tab, change the Resource’s type and make it searchable/non-searchable in the [Finder]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/finder). 
<br />
- **Content Tab:** Contains a fillable field where you can enter a link to your Resource or a description of where it’s hosted. For example, if you’re documenting a script this may be a GitHub link. 
<br />
- **Comments:** Any user authorized to view your Resource can add comments to it here viewable by all other authorized users. 
<br />
- **History:** This is an auto-generated history of the Resource that logs everything that happens to/with it. You can manually add history events by pressing the green “Add Event” button. 
<br />
- **Resource Usage:** This tab displays a list of every time the Resource is placed on a [Network]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betanetworks) or as a [Pipeline]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/PipelinesIntro) step.
<br />
- **Custom Fields:** You can create your own custom fields here. This is most often used to document Parameters when a script is run as part of a Network. [More on that here]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/documentinginstances).
<br />
- **Settings:** The settings tab is where you can authorize other users to edit your Resource.
