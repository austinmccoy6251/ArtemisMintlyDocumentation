  "The Artemis Network is a powerful tool to visualize your instances. It
  analyzes your instance archives to automatically generate maps of your
  project(s)."
---

The network is designed to be a touchstone for collaboration, ensuring every
team member, leader and stakeholder in a project can observe every facet of the
work to understand what has happened and decide what to do next.

The network can be viewed from inside your project at the "Instance Network"
tab, as seen below. You can also navigate to the network from any instance in
your archive which will open a full screen view in a new tab, highlighting the
instance you're working with.
