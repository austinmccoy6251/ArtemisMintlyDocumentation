  "The network has a set of tools that help you accomplish two main things:
  visualize your projects and explore how different aspects of them are
  connected."

## Tracing on the Network

The network makes it easy for you to find how your resources interact with one
another. Tracing is a powerful tool to accomplish this aim; it allows you to
select a certain resource then view what's connected to it in one of four ways
using the tracing buttons found on the network menu.

#### Here's a quick demonstration of what each of the tracing buttons do:

#### Here's a quick-reference table describing each button:

| Trace upstream          | Highlights all resources on the network that are upstream of the one selected                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trace downstream        | Highlights all resources on the network that are downstream of the one selected                                                                                                                       |
| Trace up and downstream | Highlights all resources on the network that are directly up and downstream of the one selected                                                                                                       |
| Trace all connected     | Highlights all resources on the network that are connected in any way to the one selected â€” note that not every resource highlighted in this view is a first string connection to your starting point |

## Expanding Your View

The network can display projects side by side by using the search tool displayed
on the right side of the network. Clicking the tool opens the window seen below
where you can select projects to add alongside the one presently displayed.

## Toggling View Modes

The network can be viewed and trace in 2 or 3D. You can toggle between modes
using the slider on the left-hand menu bar.
