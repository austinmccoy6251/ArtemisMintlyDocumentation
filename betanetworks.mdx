title: "Introduction to Networks"
---

Networks are used to diagram parts of your projects. They can be as large or small as you want. Each subproject can contain a practically unlimited number of Networks inside a unit of organization called “Modules.” Each Module contains one network and some space to track when the Network was created, what it’s for, who has changed it, etc.

**This guide will cover:**
1. Creating a Module and accessing the Network
2. Creating Instances on the Network
3. Custom Instance fields
4. Connecting Instances to one another 
5. Enhancing Instance documentation
