title: "Introduction to Networks"
---

Networks are used to diagram parts of your projects. They can be as large or small as you want. Each subproject can contain a practically unlimited number of Networks inside a unit of organization called “Modules.” Each Module contains one network and some space to track when the Network was created, what it’s for, who has changed it, etc.

**This guide will cover:**
1. [Creating a Module and accessing the Network](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/createmodule)
2. [Creating Instances on the Network](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/creatinginstances)
4. [Connecting Instances to one another ](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/connectinginstances)
5. [Custom fields and Instances](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/documentinginstances)
