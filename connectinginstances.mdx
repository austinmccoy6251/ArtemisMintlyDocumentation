title: "Connecting Instances"
---
After you place an Instance you should connect it to your Network. This means both visually connecting it (drawing an arrow) and documenting how it’s related technically to other Instances.

First, make sure “Move/Connect” is toggled on at the top of your Network. 

Then, CTRL + Click the two instances you want to connect. A window that looks like the one below will appear. The first Instance you clicked will be listed first (highlighted in green), the second will appear under that (highlighted in red).

Using the drop-down menus, select what role each Instance plays in the Relationship. Once you fill the first option, the second one will auto-fill it’s corollary. In the example provide above 

Here is a list of possible relationship roles:

* **Origin:** An origin is a resource that generates another one. For example, a script may be the origin of an output like a graph. 
 
* **Input Dataset:** As the name suggests, this is a resource that inputs data to another. For example, a database may be the input data for a script.
 
* **Output Artifact:** This is a resource that was output by another resource. For example, a graph may be the output of a script. 
 
* **Deployment:** Sometimes an Instance might be used by another Instance. This is said to be its deployment. For example, a database can be deployed to be used by a script.

* **Note:** If you find this at all confusing, don't worry. Just make a few Instances and try to document how they relate. Doing is easier than reading in this case.
