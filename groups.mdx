Groups are levels of organization inside Views. As the name suggests, they’re groups of items on your Network, and are created on the Network.

To create a Group, first be sure you’ve made a View for it to reside inside. Next, go to the Network, open the sidebar and select the View you want to work inside from the “Choose View” dropdown.
