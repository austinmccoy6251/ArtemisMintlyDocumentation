title: "Instance Network"
---
The network is where your team can diagram its data science projects. Each time a resource is placed on a network is called an “instance” of that resource. We help you make distinctions between different instances of your resources because often you’ll use the same resource in two different contexts – and that context is important to document. For example, a database may be used twice for two totally different purposes in the same project.
