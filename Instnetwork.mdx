title: "Instance Network"
---
The network is where your team can diagram its data science projects. Each time a resource is placed on a network is called an “instance” of that resource. We help you make distinctions between different instances of your resources because often you’ll use the same resource in two different contexts – and that context is important to document. For example, a database may be used twice for two totally different purposes in the same project.  

This guide will cover: 
1. How to create instances on your network
2. How to document instance relationships 

## Creating Instances
First, navigate to the network in the subproject where you’re working. You can also view the network at the project or even the network level but can only add instances from the subproject level. 

Second, press the “Add Instance” button that sits just above the network window. 

Third, place your cursor over where you’d like to have your instance appear (you can reposition it later) and RIGHT CLICK. When placing an instance your left mouse button lets you pan across the network. The right mouse button is how you place an instance. 

As soon as you click, a modal like the one below will appear.

The name and date section are fairly self-explanatory, we cover what an instance’s “pipeline status” is in the “Pipelines” section of our docs and the instance description can be filled out however you see fit. The one field that’s important to take note of at this point is the “underlying resource” box. Whichever resource you’re trying to make an instance of, copy its resource ID and paste it here.

Once you press the “Create Instance” button, it will show up on your network and a modal to document the instance will instantly appear.


* **Settings:** Lets you change who can edit the instance
