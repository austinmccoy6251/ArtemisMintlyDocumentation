Welcome to Artemis! We offer a platform to document and diagram data science projects. The walkthrough below showcases our core capabilities and introduces you to our interface. If this piques your interest but you're not yet an Artemis user please visit our [landing page](https://www.artemisplatform.com/) and get in touch!

### There are three terms you need to know before getting started:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Resources">
We use the term “Resource” in reference to any asset you document with Artemis. Some of the most common resource types are scripts, databases and models. All resources documented with Artemis appear in your [Resource Catalogs](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betaresourcecatalog).  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Networks">
[Networks](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betanetworks) are where you diagram how your different Resources relate. Please note that they’re different from Pipelines. Networks are prefect for exploring a new idea and document your process. However, if you want to create a set of processes that you’ll run multiple times you should create a Pipeline to document both structure and the parameters/results of each run. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Instances">
Every time a Resource appears on a Network we call that an Instance of said Resource. For example, you may have one script used over and over again in different ways throughout a project. You can document each instance separately, capturing its unique context, even though it’s the same resource.

    Diagram your work on the Network.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Caputre metadata as your Pipelines run" icon="timeline" color="#16a34a" href="google.com">
    Artemis lets you visualize how your pipeliens are laid out and capture the different parameters used each time they're run.
