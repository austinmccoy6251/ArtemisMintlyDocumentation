When you first enter Artemis, there will be a demo example Workspace created for you. It’s called “Machine Learning Team” and contains two Projects called “Core ML Model” and “ML Exploration. These show how you can use Artemis to document a stable pipeline and some experimental work, respectively. 

This walkthrough above takes you through the example workspace if you don’t want to do it alone!
