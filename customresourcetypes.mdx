title: "Custom Resource Types"
---
Artemis comes pre-populated with some of the most common Resource types, but it’s probable you’ll need to create your own. The walkthrough below demonstrates this process.

<Card title="Important Note">
Artemis will ask you to choose an icon that corresponds with the new type you’re creating. A search bar will appear, and you can enter names of icons into it. We use the Font Awesome icon library. It’s best to look up the icon you want [on their website]( https://fontawesome.com/search), then copy the name into Artemis.
