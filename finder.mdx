The Finder is a tab that appears on the left-hand tab bar in your Workspaces, Projects and Subprojects. It lets you search for Resources, Modules, Subprojects and Pipelines.

The Finder only lets you search the “vertical” you’re presently inside. For example, if you access the Finder from a Workspace you can only discover assets inside that Workspace..

### Types of Finder Searches
You can change the search method you’re using to look up assets and change which type of assets you’re looking for using the two drop down menus at the top of your Finder window.

**Search Types:** You can toggle between these three types of searches using the leftmost drop-down menu at the top of the Finder window.

1. A standard search lets you look things up by title.
2. A smart search lets you search keywords and pulls up assets with similar or related titles.
3. A deep search is like a smart search but applied beyond the title – looking through items’ descriptions and more.

**Target Assets:** You can display different search results sorted by asset type (Resource, Module, etc.) using the rightmost drop-down menu at the top of the Finder window.
