title: "Finder"

The Finder is a tool that appears on the left hand toolbar at various levels of organization inside Artemis. It can be used to search Resources and Modules nested under whichever level you're at when you enter the finder.

For example, if you’re in a Workspace and search for all resources named “dog,” you’ll see results from across all Projects inside that Workspace. If you make that same search from a specific project, however, you’ll only see results from inside that Project.

### Tools to enhance your search:
There are several tools you can leverage to find what you’re looking for more quickly.

**Standard, Smart and Deep searches**: You can toggle between these three types of searches using the drop down menu left of the search bar. 
1.	A standard search lets you look things up by title.
2.	A smart search lets you search keywords and pulls up assets with similar or related titles.
3.	A deep search is like a smart search, but applied beyond the title – looking through items’ descriptions and more.

**Resource vs Module searches**: You can toggle between searching Resources and Modules using the drop down menu beneath the green search button. By default, all searches will be for Resources. You can use the “Search Type” feature to designate which kinds of resources you’re concerned with. Toggling to a Module-only search will eliminate the Search Type field.
