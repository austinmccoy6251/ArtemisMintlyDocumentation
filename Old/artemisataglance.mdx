title: "Artemis at a Glance"

Artemis is a platform to document and diagram data science projects. We let individuals and teams keep track of every resource used in their projects, recording how and when they were employed. 

This type of documentation is different from how you’d document software projects. When you’re documenting a software project you’re tracking the evolution of a single resource across multiple iterations. Data science projects, on the other hand, require you to document multiple discrete resources, how they evolve and the interplay between them. This requires a new structure, which we provide.

## Artemis Pillars 
Artemis lets you keep track of all the resources used in your projects in what we call a “resource catalog.” Then, we help you arrange them on interactive diagrams we call “networks” to create visual maps of your work. Each time a resource is placed on a network is called an “instance” of that resource. Every instance you create and document is also stored and displayed in the "instance archive."

These are the three pillars of Artemis: The Resource Catalog, Network and Instance Archive.

This diagram models the interplay between these aspects of our system:

## Artemis Structure
Naturally, you’ll want to create multiple projects (networks and their accompanying resource catalogs and instance archives). If you’re inside a large organization you may also want to give different groups of people access to different projects while hiding what other groups are working on. Artemis lets you do that; you can create various workspaces inside your organization and each workspace can contain multiple projects.
