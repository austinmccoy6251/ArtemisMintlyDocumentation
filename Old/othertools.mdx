title: Other Tools
---
The core pillars of Artemis are the Resource Catalog and Instance Network, but our platform also includes a handful of other tools you can use to work smarter. 

## Instance Archives
The main way to interact with instances is via the network. However, there are times when you might want to view all the instances involved in a given subproject in one place without navigating the network. 

This is what the Instance Archive is for. Here’s a short video that provides an overview of its features:

## Pipelines
Artemis offers a built-for-purpose solution to document pipelines – collections of resources you run multiple times.

Before you learn how to use the pipeline tool, take a moment and be sure you understand Instance Networks, because most of the mechanics involved are the same. 

To create a pipeline, enter a subproject and select the “pipeline” option from the left hand toolbar. 

Then, select to create a new pipeline using the green button at the upper right hand corner. A modal will instantly appear letting you name your pipeline (and categorize it if desired). Once you do this, a modal that looks like the one below will instantly appear. Select the second tab (cube icon) to start creating your pipeline.

Pipelines are build in the same fashion as networks, using the right click to place items on the diagram. However, when you’re making a pipeline you are NOT creating new instances. Rather, you’re just laying out what resources are involved in the pipeline. 

Finally, each time you run the pipeline you can click the second to last tab on the pipeline modal to add another instance of the entire line itself alongside notes that describe that individual run. 

## Finder
The finder is a superpowered search bar. It can be found on the left-hand sidebar at the organizational, workspace and project levels (not subproject). It can be used to find anything contained inside the level you’re at. For example, the finder accessed from the organizational level lets you search for workspaces, projects, subprojects, pipelines, resources and instances. By this same token, accessing the finder at the project level only lets you search things that can be inside projects: resources, pipelines and instances.

In brief, the finder lets you find things inside whatever level of organization you’re at.

## AI Assistants

When you’re in a subproject a little blue icon that looks like a computer chip will appear at the bottom right corner of your screen. Clicking this will reveal a pop up with three icons: a magnifying glass, light bulb and settings icon. These are a semantic search tool, AI-explainer and settings. 

**Semantic search** is enabled when you enter a resource catalog or Instance Archive and allows you to query for items even when you don’t know their names. Simply input keywords similar to what you’re looking for, press search and relevant assets will appear.

**AI-explainer** is most useful when a member of your team leaves a description that’s overly reliant on technical language. Copy and paste any text into this tool and hit “explain” to have it described in simpler terms. 

## Event logs
Event logs automatically track and report the history of various spaces. It can be found on the left-hand sidebar at any level. Accessing the log at the project level reports the history of that project. Clicking into the log for a workspace displays the history of that workspace – and so on.

## Comments
Comments function like event logs only they display user generated comments instead of system-generated reports of events.

## Trash
When you’re looking at your list of workspaces, projects, subprojects, instances or resources you’ll notice a toggle switch at the upper right hand corner that says “trash.” Actuating this switch reveals deleted versions of whatever you’re looking at.

Note: if you’ve deleted something that contains other things, like a workspace, you need to restore the resource before you enter it. You cannot browse the content of deleted things before restoring them.
