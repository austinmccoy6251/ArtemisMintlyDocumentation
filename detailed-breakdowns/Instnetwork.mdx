Networks are used to diagram parts of your projects. They can be as large or small as you want. Each subproject can contain a practically unlimited number of Networks inside a unit of organization called “Modules.” Each Module contains one network and some space to track when the Network was created, what it’s for, who has changed it, etc.

**This guide will cover:**
1. Creating a Module and accessing the Network
2. Creating Instances on the Network
3. Connecting Instances to one another 
4. Enhancing Instance documentation

### Creating a Module
Modules exist inside your Subprojects. They’re created by entering the Subproject, clicking the “Modules” tab on the left side and selecting the green “New Modules” button

Here’s a quick walk through:

### Creating Instances on the Network
Every time you document a use of a resource on your network, we call that an instance. There can be many instances of each resource. Here’s a video that illustrates the process of creating an instance.

Adding Instances to a Network is a quick and easy process:

**First**, open the module you’re working in and press the second tab in the modal to call up the Network.

**Second**, press the “Add Instance” button that sits just above the Network window

**Third**, place your cursor over where you’d like to have your Instance appear (you can reposition it later) and RIGHT CLICK. When placing an Instance your left mouse button lets you pan across the Network. The right mouse button is how you place an Instance.

**Finally**, when you click, a modal will appear asking what you’d like to name your Instance and what Resource it’s an instance of. Open your Resource Catalog in another tab, click on the Resource you’re working with, copy it’s Resource ID and paste it into the Instance creation modal. 

When you click the green “Create Instance” button, you Instance will appear.

### Connecting Instances
Connecting Instances is quick and easy. Here’s a video going over the process:

Instances can be related to one another in four ways. An Instance can be another Instances origin or input if it’s the “upstream” instance in the relationship. “Downstream” instances can either be artifacts (created by the upstream Instance) or deployments (using an upstream database.) Here’s a reference table:

* **Origin:** An origin is a resource that generates another one. For example, a script may be the origin of an output like a graph. 
* 
* **Input Dataset:** As the name suggests, this is a resource that inputs data to another. For example, a database may be the input data for a script.
* 
* **Output Artifact:** This is a resource that was output by another resource. For example, a graph may be the output of a script. 
* 
* **Deployment:** Sometimes an Instance might be used by another Instance. This is said to be its deployment. For example, a database can be deployed to be used by a script.
* 
**Note:** If you find this at all confusing, don't worry. Just make a few Instances and try to document how they relate. Doing is easier than reading in this case.

## Documenting Instances

After you document Instance relationships you can click on an Instance and this modal will appear.

</Frame>
This screen shows you details about the resource. Here’s what each tab does, in order of appearance: 

* **Overview Tab:** Displays general information about the Instance.

* **Resource Details Tab:** Displays information about the Instance's underlying resource.

* **Resource Content Tab:** Reports where the underlying resource is located.

* **Input Datasets:** Indicates which (if any) datasets the Instance relies on. The info on this tab is created by the relationships you define between Instances.

* **Output Artifacts:** Indicates which (if any) Instances are output by the one you’re looking at. The info on this tab is created by the relationships you define between Instances.

* **Origin:** If your Instance was created by another one, that’s reported here. The info on this tab is created by the relationships you define between Instances.

* **Deployments:** If your Instance is used by another Instance, that’s reported here. The info on this tab is created by the relationships you define between Instances.

* **Network:** Clicking this button displays the iNstance on the Network

* **Comments:** Any user can add comments on your Instance

* **History:** This tab reports every action done to an Instance

* **Settings:** Lets you change who can edit the Instance
