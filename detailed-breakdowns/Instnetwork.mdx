title: "Experiment Network"
---
The experiment network is where your team can diagram each of their data science projects. Every time you place a resource on the network is called an “instance” of that resource.

This guide will cover: 
1. The Experiment Network tab
2. Creating instances
3. Connecting instances
4. Documenting instances

## Experiment Network
Each subproject has its own set of experiments, accessible via the left-hand toolbar. You can have multiple experiments per subproject. Each experiment is a modal with four tabs: a main info tab, the network, a comment section and a changelog.

## Creating Instancess
Instances are created on the instance network to show when and how resources are deployed as part of your work. Here's a video illustrating the process:

First, navigate to the network in the subproject where you’re working. You can also view the network at the project or even the network level but can only add instances from the subproject level. 

Second, press the “Add Instance” button that sits just above the network window. 

Third, place your cursor over where you’d like to have your instance appear (you can reposition it later) and RIGHT CLICK. When placing an instance your left mouse button lets you pan across the network. The right mouse button is how you place an instance. 

As soon as you click, a modal like the one below will appear.

The name and date section are fairly self-explanatory, we cover what an instance’s “pipeline status” is in the “Pipelines” section of our docs and the instance description can be filled out however you see fit. The one field that’s important to take note of at this point is the “underlying resource” box. Whichever resource you’re trying to make an instance of, copy its resource ID and paste it here.

Once you press the “Create Instance” button, it will show up on your network and a modal to document the instance will instantly appear.


## Connecting Instances
Once you have more than one instance on your network it’s time to document how they relate. The video below walks you through that process.

At 0:28 in the video we start working with a modal that lets us document how the two resources are related. There are four different things a resource can be in a relationship. These are: origins, input datasets, output artifacts and deployments. Each of these is defined in detail below. When you’re documenting how two instances are related you only need to tell Artemis what one half of the relationship is and our system automatically takes care of the other. 

For example, imagine you’re documenting the connection between a script and a graph it produces. If you note that the graph is the artifact in this dynamic the script will automatically be noted as the graph’s origin.

* **Origin:** An origin is a resource that generates another one. For example, a script may be the origin of an output like a graph. 

* **Input Dataset:** As the name suggests, this is a resource that inputs data to another. For example, a database may be the input data for a script.

* **Output Artifact:** This is a resource that was output by another resource. For example, a graph may be the output of a script. 

* **Deployment:** Sometimes an instance might be used by another instance. This is said to be its deployment. For example, a database can be deployed to be used by a script.

**Note:** If you find this at all confusing, don't worry. Just make a few instances and try to document how they relate. Doing is easier than reading in this case.

## Documenting Instances

After you document instance relationships you can click on an instance and this modal will appear.

</Frame>
This screen shows you details about the resource. Here’s what each tab does, in order of appearance: 

* **Overview Tab:** Displays general information about the instance.

* **Resource Details Tab:** Displays information about the instance's underlying resource.

* **Resource Content Tab:** Reports where the underlying resource is located.

* **Input Datasets:** Indicates which (if any) datasets the instance relies on. The info on this tab is created by the relationships you define between instances.

* **Output Artifacts:** Indicates which (if any) instances are output by the one you’re looking at. The info on this tab is created by the relationships you define between instances.

* **Origin:** If your instance was created by another one, that’s reported here. The info on this tab is created by the relationships you define between instances.

* **Deployments:** If your instance is used by another instance, that’s reported here. The info on this tab is created by the relationships you define between instances.

* **Network:** Clicking this button displays the instance on the network

* **Comments:** Any user can add comments on your instance

* **History:** This tab reports every action done to an instance

* **Settings:** Lets you change who can edit the instance
