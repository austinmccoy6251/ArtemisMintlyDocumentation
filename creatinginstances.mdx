Every time you document a use of a resource on your network, we call that an instance. There can be many instances of each resource. Here’s a video that illustrates the process of creating an instance.

The process described in the walkthrough above can also be summarized in these four steps:

**First**, open the module you’re working in and press the second tab in the modal to call up the Network.

**Second**, press the “Add Instance” button that sits just above the Network window

**Third**, place your cursor over where you’d like to have your Instance appear (you can reposition it later) and RIGHT CLICK. When placing an Instance your left mouse button lets you pan across the Network. The right mouse button is how you place an Instance.

**Finally**, when you click, a modal will appear asking what you’d like to name your Instance and what Resource it’s an instance of. Open your Resource Catalog in another tab, click on the Resource you’re working with, copy it’s Resource ID and paste it into the Instance creation modal. 

When you click the green “Create Instance” button, you Instance will appear.
