Each time you place a Resource on your Network is called an “Instance” of that Resource. All Instances of a Resource point back to the Resource itself, but also include context-specific documentation (most commonly parameters).

Instances are created on the Network. Enter the Network, press the “New Instance” button and RIGHT CLICK to place it.

A window will appear prompting you to indicate which Resource you’re creating an Instance of. You can search for Resources using a provided drop down menu, or paste in a Resource ID for a more direct lookup.

Pressing the green “Create Instance” button closes the window and an Instance will appear where you right clicked. You can then connect the Instance to your Network and document related parameters (or have our API do it for you).
