Modules are containers you can create inside your Subprojects. Each Module has 4 parts: 
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title=" Network">
  The Network is where you can diagram your work. Networks can be created by one or more users to represent how your Resources relate to one another. The Networks tab is where you’ll spend most your time in the Module. Click [here]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betanetworks) for a more details on the Network.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title=" Views">
</Accordion>
<Accordion title=" Comments">
  Users can leave comments on a Module that can be viewed by everyone else who checks the Module’s comment section. 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title=" History">
  Everything that happens to/in your Module from creating and naming it to altering and growing your Network is automatically recorded in the Module history. You can also add custom events to the Module’s log.
