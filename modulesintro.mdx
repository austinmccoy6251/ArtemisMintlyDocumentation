title: "Introduction to Modules"
---
Every Subproject has a Modules tab. Each Module holds a Network to diagram part of your work and has tools to view this Network in various ways. You can create an effectively unlimited number of Networks inside each Subproject.

This page will help you navigate the Modules themselves. Next, there is a series of pages to help you build Networks. 

### Navigating the Module
There are a few tabs inside a Module that you should be aware of. The image below shows you what they look like.

In order of appearance, here’s what each of them do: 

- **General Info:** This tab displays general information about the Module. You can use the green “Edit Details” button to change the Module’s name and add notes about it here.
<br />
- **Network:** The second tab is where you’ll probably spent 90% of your time inside a Module. It displays your Network.
<br />
- **Views:** This is the second most important tab inside the Module. It lets you create tables that display parameters of whichever parts of your work you’d like.
<br />
- **Comments:** Users can leave comments visible to other users about the Module. 
<br />
- **History:** This tab automatically records everything that happened with, in or to the Module. You can also add events manually with the green “Add Event” button.
