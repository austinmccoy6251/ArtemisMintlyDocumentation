title: "Projects"

Projects are created inside Workspaces. They are fairly large units of organization that can contain an effectively unlimited number of Subprojects. 

Most users set all Projects inside a Workspace to be accessible to every user in the space. However, this is not the default setting of a Project. You can set Projects to be accessible by as many or as few Workspace members as you like.

### Pipelines 
Pipelines are created at the Project level. Artemis allows you to diagram the structure of your Pipelines then track each time they’re run and the parameters/results used.

Each Project can have an effectively unlimited number of Pipelines. Pipelines are created at the Project level because they’re often the culmination of a team’s efforts on the Project – it wouldn’t make sense to hide them away inside Subprojects!  

### Walkthrough
This walkthrough demonstrates the process of entering a Workspace, creating a Project and adding new users to it. We also take a look at where Pipelines are created, but this process is explained fully in its own [section](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/PipelinesIntro).
