title: "Projects"

Projects are created inside Workspaces. They are fairly large units of organization that can contain an effectively unlimited number of Subprojects. 

Most users set all Projects inside a Workspace to be accessible to every user in the space. However, this is not the default setting of a Project. You can set Projects to be accessible by as many or as few Workspace members as you like.

### Walkthrough
This walkthrough demonstrates the process of entering a Workspace, creating a Project and adding new users to it.
