title: "Projects"

Projects are created inside Workspaces to help teams define objectives they’re working on. Each project can host several Subprojects that serve to break that task down into workable bits. No resources are documented, or work diagramed at the Project level. Projects exist to help groups of users organize around a set of Subprojects.

<Accordion title="Creating a Project">
Projects are created from the Workspace “General” tab using the green “Add Project” button. When you press that button, you’ll be prompted to name your Project and categorize it if you’d like. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Adding users to a Project">
Users are added to Projects via the “Users” tab on the left hand menu bar. You can only add users you’ve previously added to your organization. Refer to the “Adding Users” section on this page if you need help with that. 
</Accordion>
  
<Accordion title="Finder">
The finder is accessible at all organizational levels of Artemis. Whatever level you’re at, the finder lets you search beneath it.
  
For example, using the finder from a Project lets you search Resources and Modules inside it. (Note: the Finder in the Projects will not help you search Subprojects, as they are clearly listed on the Project’s “Subprojects” tab.)

There are three ways to use the finder. 
1. A standard search lets you look things up by title.
2. A smart search lets you search keywords and pulls up assets with similar or related titles. 
3. A deep search is like a smart search, but applied beyond the title – looking through items’ descriptions and more.
</Accordion>
  
<Accordion title="Comments">
This is a tab where you can leave comments on a Project – as the name implies. Any user with permission to be in a Project can leave comments visible to all other users. 
</Accordion>
  
<Accordion title="Event Log">
The Log automatically records everything that happens to a Project. For example, it will report when users are added, or new Subprojects are created. You can also manually add events to the log by pressing the green “Add Event” button.
