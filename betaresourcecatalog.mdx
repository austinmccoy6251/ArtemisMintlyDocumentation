title: "Resource Catalog"
---
Resource Catalogs exist inside Subprojects and provide a shared space for teams to document what assets (scripts, databases, models, etc.) are used in their work. 

Each entry into the Catalog represents one Resource and contains information about its location, function, a comment section and more. 

You can think of your Resource Catalog as a pallet of paints that you use to illustrate your Network. Every Resource you place onto a Network to diagram your work will appear in the Catalog.
