title: "Resource Catalog"
---
Artemis lets you create bundles of documentation that correspond with your scripts, databases, models, and other assets. We call these bundles “Resources” and let you store them in “Resource Catalogs” which sit inside your Subprojects. 

Resources come pre-populated with fields to record an asset’s location and other important information about it. However, you can also create custom fields as needed to capture parameters (or anything else you need to record) in a standardized way. Both custom and standard fields are API fillable, which means you can create and document Resources in seconds.

The idea behind Resources and their Catalogs is that you can keep track of every asset brought to bear on your work and see what your team members are using as well. You can then diagram how these Resources relate on the [Network]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betanetworks).
