title: "Resource Catalog"
---
Every subproject contains a resource catalog where your team can record what assets (like scripts, databases, models, etc.) are used.

**This guide will cover:**
1. How to create and document a resource
2. How to create custom resource types
3. Creating custom Resource fields
4. How to create new resource versions

## Creating and Documenting a Resource
The Resource Catalog is one place for an entire team to document what assets they're bringing to bear on their work. Adding to the Catalog is quick and easy:

The video above gives a high level overview of a few tools we’ll now take a closer look at:

* **Main Tab:** The main tab displays the resource name, its ID number and a handful of other useful datapoints about the asset.

* **Resource Content:** This tab is a place to store information about the location of your resource. For example, if you’re documenting a script this is likely a GitHub link.

* **Comments:** This is where members of your team can leave notes about a resource. These are public to everybody who visits the resource – not direct messages to its creator!

* **History:** Every time a resource is edited in any way or an instance is generated of it a new “event” will be logged on its history tab. You can also manually add custom events here.

* **Instances:** This tab lets you view all the instances of this resource in one place.

* **Settings:** The primary function of this tab is to change who has edit privileges for this resource.

### Custom Resource Fields
Often, the fields listed above aren't sufficient to document resources. You may want to record a set of specific parameters in a standardized way across different assets. The walkthrough below covers the process of creating custom fields. 
*This process can be automated with our API coming mid-March 2023.*

## Custom Resource Types
Artemis comes preloaded with some of the common resource types most people will use. However it’s probable that your work will necessitate new types. Here’s how you do that:

## Creating Versions
Cutting new versions of a resource is super easy. You might want to do this if anything notable about it changes. You simply expand the drop down version menu on the main tab of the resource and cut a new one. Note that your resource ID stays the same across versions.
