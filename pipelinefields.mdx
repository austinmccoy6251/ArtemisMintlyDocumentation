title: "Pipeline Fields"
---

Artemis lets you diagram the structure of your Pipelines and record the parameters/results of each run. You can use Views to see how these vary from run to run in table format.

There are two steps to set up a successful Pipeline View. First youâ€™ll need to define custom fields where your parameters/results can be recorded. Then you can create a view to display whichever combination of fields is most helpful. 

This page explains how you create custom fields, the next one covers creating a view. 

**Custom fields** are created inside Pipeline steps. You define them after first creating your Pipeline and fill them out for each step (you can also use our API to avoid doing this by hand). 

### Walkthrough
This guide shows you how to create and locate fields.
