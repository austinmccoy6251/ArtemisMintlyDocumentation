title: "Pipeline Fields"
---

Artemis lets you diagram the steps used in your Pipeline and record each time it’s run. You can then enter each run and record its parameters/results. Finally, you can view these parameters/results side by side using Pipeline Views. 

However, before you can do any of this, you need to set up what fields each Pipeline step needs. You do this by going to your Pipeline diagram, clicking on each step and setting up custom Fields that will hold parameters/results for each of your runs. 

For example, you may diagram a pipeline that you’ll run many times as the input dataset is updated with new real-world data. Therefore, you should create a custom Field on the database Pipeline step to record the date the data was last updated at the time of each run. Similarly, your Pipeline may generate CSV files each time it’s run. You should probably create a field for the corresponding Pipeline step to record where each run’s file is located.

Once you do this, you’ll be able to enter your runs and input values for each custom field. (Or use our API if you don’t want to do this by hand. 

### Walkthrough
The following walkthrough shows you where to create custom Fields for Pipeline steps.
