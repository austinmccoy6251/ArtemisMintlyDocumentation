title: "Workspaces"

Workspaces store Projects and make them accessible to a set of users that you add to the space. 

You can think of Workspaces like sections of an office: spaces to group together team members who will coordinate frequently around a set of projects.

### Adding Users
Before you add users to your Workspace, you need to make sure they’re on your organization’s Roster. Users are added to your Roster by email – you enter the address associated with their Artemis account. 

Adding someone to your Roster by email is a one-time step. Once a user is in your Roster they can be added to Workspaces, Projects and Subprojects by name.

### Walkthrough
This walkthrough covers adding users to your Roster, creating a Workspace and adding users to that Workspace.
