title: "Workspaces"
---
Workspaces store Projects and make them accessible to a set of users that you add to the space. 

You can think of Workspaces like sections of an office: spaces to group together team members who will coordinate frequently around a set of projects.

### Adding Users
Before you add users to your Workspace, you need to make sure they’re on your organization’s Roster. Users are added to your Roster by email – you enter the address associated with their Artemis account. 

Adding someone to your Roster by email is a one-time step. Once a user is in your Roster they can be added to Workspaces, Projects and Subprojects by name.

### Walkthrough
This walkthrough covers adding users to your Roster, creating a Workspace and adding users to that Workspace.

### Other Workspace Features 
The **Event Log** automatically records everything that happens to a Workspace. For example, it will report when users are added, or new Projects are created. You can also manually add events to the log by pressing the green “Add Event” button.

The **[Finder]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/finder)** lets you search anything (Resources, Modules, Subprojects, Pipelines) inside your Workspace.
