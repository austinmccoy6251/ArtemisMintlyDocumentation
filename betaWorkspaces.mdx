title: "Workspaces"

Workspaces store Projects and make them accessible to a set of users that you add to the space. 

You can think of Workspaces like sections of an office: spaces to group together team members who will coordinate frequently around a set of projects.

### Adding Users
Before you add users to your Workspace, you need to make sure they’re on your organization’s Roster. Users are added to your Roster by email – you enter the address associated with their Artemis account. 

Adding someone to your Roster by email is a one-time step. Once a user is in your Roster they can be added to Workspaces, Projects and Subprojects by name.

### Walkthrough
This walkthrough covers adding users to your Roster, creating a Workspace and adding users to that Workspace.

Step One: Add User to your Organization

Before you can add a user to your Workspace, be sure they’re already a member of your Organization. Do this by entering the “Settings” tab on the left hand menu bar and selecting “Users” from the sub menu when it appears. 

Next, press the green “Add User” button. A modal will appear asking for a user’s “ID Number.” Every Artemis user is assigned an ID when they first get their login credentials. Ask the person you’re trying to add for their ID Number and paste it in here. 

This user can now be added by name to all Workspaces, Projects and Subprojects inside your Organization. 

Note: if you add a user as an “Admin,” they’ll have full, unrestricted access to everything in your Org. This is great for smaller teams who don’t want to permission every Workspace, Project and Subproject. Many larger teams, however, add most members as “Users.” 

Step Two: Add user to your Workspace

When you create your Workspace (from the Home page using the green “New Workspace” button). Enter the Workspace and click the “Users” tab on the left hand menu bar. Press the green “Add User” button and add them by name.

<Accordion title="Event Log">
The Log automatically records everything that happens to a Workspace. For example, it will report when users are added, or new Projects are created. You can also manually add events to the log by pressing the green “Add Event” button.
