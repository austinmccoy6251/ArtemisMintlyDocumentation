title: "Subprojects"
---

The Subproject is where work occurs. Higher levels of organization are designed to partition users into different teams and working groups to effectively collaborate around the work content hosted at the Subproject level.

Each subproject contains a [Resource Catalog](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betaresourcecatalog) and series of [Modules](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betanetworks). The Catalog is a place to record details about every resource used on a project like its location. The Modules are little containers for Networks that diagram how these Resources relate.

This is a more detailed Walkthrough that covers every detail of documenting a Resource, adding an Instance of that Resource to the Network and documenting how different Resources are related. We recommend you consult this guide if you’re ever confused about the mechanics of creating Resources and working with Networks.

Subprojects primary function is to contain Resource Catalogs and Modules/Networks. Please refer to their respective sections of documentation to learn more.
