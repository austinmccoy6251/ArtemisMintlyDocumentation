[This is a Walkthrough that provides a brief tour of a Subproject.](https://app.storylane.io/share/bjiicczserfx)

The Subproject is where work occurs. Higher levels of organization are designed to partition users into different teams and working groups to effectively collaborate around the work content hosted at the Subproject level.

Each subproject contains a Resource Catalog and series of Modules. The Catalog is a place to record details about every resource used on a project like its location. The Modules are little containers for Networks that diagram how these Resources relate.

This is a more detailed Walkthrough that covers every detail of documenting a Resource, adding an Instance of that Resource to the Network and documenting how different Resources are related. We recommend you consult this guide if you’re ever confused about the mechanics of creating Resources and working with Networks.

**Subprojects primary function is to contain Resource Catalogs and Modules/Networks. Please refer to their respective sections of documentation to learn more.**

<Accordion title="Adding Useres to Subprojects">
Users are added to Subproject via the “Users” tab on the left hand menu bar. You can only add users you’ve previously added to your organization. Refer to the “Adding Users” section on this page if you need help with that. 
</Accordion>
  
<Accordion title="Finder">
The finder is accessible at all organizational levels of Artemis. Whatever level you’re at, the finder lets you search beneath it.
  
For example, using the finder from a Subproject lets you search Resources and Modules inside it. 
  
There are three ways to use the finder. 
1. A standard search lets you look things up by title.
2. A smart search lets you search keywords and pulls up assets with similar or related titles. 
3. A deep search is like a smart search, but applied beyond the title – looking through items’ descriptions and more.

<Accordion title="Comments">
This is a tab where you can leave comments on a Subproject – as the name implies. Any user with permission to be in a Subproject can leave comments visible to all other users. 
</Accordion>
  
<Accordion title="Event Log">
The Log automatically records everything that happens to a Subproject. For example, it will report when users are added, or new Resources and Modules are created. You can also manually add events to the log by pressing the green “Add Event” button.
