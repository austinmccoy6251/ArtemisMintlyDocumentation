title: "Subprojects"
---
Subprojects are the smallest level of organization inside Artemis. While Workspaces and Projects help you organize your team, Subproject organize your work. 

Subprojects are created inside Projects. Most people set all Subprojects to be accessible to every user in the Project. However, this is not the default setting of a Subproject. You can set Subprojects to be accessible by as many or as few Project members as you like.

Each Subproject contains a Resource Catalog and Modules. The Catalog is where you can document all the Resources (like scripts, databases, models, etc.) involved in a section of your work. Modules are used to create Networks that diagram how these Resources relate. 

Both the [Resource Catalog]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betaresourcecatalog) and [Modules/Networks]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/modulesintro) are explained in great detail in their own sections.

### Walkthrough
This walkthrough provides a tour of Subprojects and shows you where to find Resource Catalogs and Modules.
