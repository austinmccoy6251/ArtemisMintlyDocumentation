Pipeline Views allow you to view the parameters/results of Pipeline runs on a digestible table. This saves you the trouble of paging through each run to examine parameters one-by-one.
 
After you’ve created custom fields, run your Pipeline and recorded values in those fields it’s quick and easy to set up a view. These Views display rows of runs with columns that show whatever parameters/results you’ve selected. 

The walkthrough below demonstrates the process of creating a Pipeline View.
 
### Walkthrough
This walkthrough is a direct continuation of the one featured in the last section that demonstrated how you can create custom fields to document your Pipelines. In that example, we worked with a Pipeline that took data from a perpetually updating database, transformed it and output a CSV file. 

In this example we’re recording one parameter and one result. These are the date the input dataset was last updated before each run and the CSV file output by each run respectively. 

This walkthrough will show you how to create Views that display parameters/results like these in table format.
