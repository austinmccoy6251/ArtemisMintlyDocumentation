title: "Introduction to Views"
---
Data science frequently entails comparing different experiments against one another in order to see how inputs and parameters influence outcomes. 

Artemis allows you to accomplish this using **Views**. Views allow you to **group** sets of connected instances (think trials) and then compare these groups by their **fields**. These fields capture metadata such as parameters, file paths, and other pieces of metadata unique to a particular instance of a resource.


Views enable you to rapidly compare parameters across [Instances]( https://docs.artemisplatform.com/atglancebeta#need-to-know-terms) of your Resources. For example, this view lets a user review how large the CSV files generated by their project are:

<Frame caption="This is a simple example of how Views can be used">

</Frame>

There are a few things you need to understand before making your first View. The following pages of our docs explain each of these in detail!
1.	[Custom fields](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/CustomFields)
2.	[Groups](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/groups)

### Broad Overview
Creating a view boils down to three steps: 

First you need to define custom fields for your Resources.

Second you create a View to define what you’d like to compare. 

Finally, you visit the Network and select groups of Instances you’re trying to compare.
