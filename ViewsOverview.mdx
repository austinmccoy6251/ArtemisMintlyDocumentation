title: "Introduction to Views"

Data science frequently entails comparing different experiments against one another in order to see how inputs and parameters influence outcomes. 

Artemis allows you to accomplish this using **Views**. Views allow you to **group** sets of connected instances (think trials) and then compare these groups by their **fields**. These fields capture metadata such as parameters, file paths, and other pieces of metadata unique to a particular instance of a resource.

<Accordion title="Practical Example">
Imagine you conduct an experiment to assess how different types of fertilizer affect the average height of a plant. 

You make three CSV files documenting how tall your plants grew with each of the three fertilizers. Imagine each file has a few key metrics involved. Perhaps each reports the plant’s average heights and root depths. 

In Artemis, you document three CSV Resources. As you diagram your work, these CSV Resources end up on your Network. 

While the Network is a great way to see how these CSVs fit into your research it doesn’t let you quickly compare the attributes of each Resource involved. This is why we created the Views feature. 

In this fertilizer experiment example you’d make custom [fields]([https://docs.artemisplatform.com/CustomFields](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/CustomFields)) in each CSV Resource to record each CSV file’s key metrics. Specifically, you’d have fields in each Resource to highlight the plants’ heights and root depths.

In your View tab, you can now compare these values across Resources.

### Broad Overview
Creating a view boils down to three steps: 

1. Define custom fields for your Resources.

2. Create a View to define what you’d like to compare. 

3. Visit the Network and select groups of Instances you’re trying to compare.
