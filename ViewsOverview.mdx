title: "Introduction to Views"
---
Data science frequently entails comparing different experiments against one another in order to see how inputs and parameters influence outcomes. 

Artemis allows you to accomplish this using **Views**. Views allow you to **group** sets of connected instances (think trials) and then compare these groups by their **fields**. These fields capture metadata such as parameters, file paths, and other pieces of metadata unique to a particular instance of a resource.



### Broad Overview
Creating a view boils down to three steps: 

1. Define custom fields for your Resources.

2. Create a View to define what you’d like to compare. 

3. Visit the Network and select groups of Instances you’re trying to compare.
