  presently under development."

#### Semantic Search

This tool allows you to locate resources inside a project without knowing what
they're called. This is useful for large projects and teams when every member
doesn't know each resource by name. The semantic search bar lets you type in a
description of what you need or related terms to return a list of resources that
match your description.

For example, rather than searching a script called "Modeling Air Resistance of
Fixed Rudder Aircraft" by name you could ask the search bar for "airplane
scripts," "flight" or "air resistance calculator."

To access semantic search enter a project, click the round button that appears
at the bottom right of your screen and click the magnifying glass icon.

#### Content Explainer

Often each member of a team has a different technical background. This can make
for frustrating moments when one person uses a term like "Cholesky
decomposition" in a resource description, rending that asset incomprehensible to
their peers.

Our content explainer tool lets users highlight things they don't understand or
copy and paste in opaque terms to return plain English descriptions. For
example, a script may be documented to employ "principal components analysis of
dataset using Cholesky decomposition." Our AI explainer will clarify what this
means as seen below.

To access this tool enter a project, click the round button that appears at the
bottom right of your screen and click the lightbulb icon.
