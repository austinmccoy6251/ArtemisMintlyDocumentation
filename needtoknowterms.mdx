title: "Need to Know Terms"
---
We try to use as little lingo as possible ... But here are a few words we use a lot!

<Card title="Resources" icon="grid">
We use the term “Resource” in reference to any asset you document with Artemis. Some of the most common resource types are scripts, databases and models. All resources documented with Artemis appear in your [Resource Catalogs](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betaresourcecatalog).  
</Card>

<Card title="Networks" icon="chart-network">
[Networks](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betanetworks) are where you diagram how your different Resources relate. Please note that they’re different from Pipelines. Networks are prefect for exploring a new idea and document your process. 
</br>
However, if you want to create a set of processes that you’ll run multiple times you should create a Pipeline to document both structure and the parameters/results of each run.  
</Card>

<Card title="Instances" icon="info">
Every time a Resource appears on a Network we call that an Instance of said Resource. For example, you may have one script used over and over again in different ways throughout a project. You can document each Instance separately, capturing its unique context, even though it’s the same resource.

</Frame>
</Accordion>

</Card>

<Card title="Pipelines" icon="timeline-arrow">
Like Networks, [Pipelines](google.com) let you visualize how Resources relate. Unlike Networks, however, Pipelines let you capture parameters/results each time you run the process you’ve diagramed.
</Card>

<Card title="Levels of Organization" icon="warehouse-full">
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organizing your Team">
Artemis lets you divide your team(s) into [Workspaces](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betaWorkspaces) and create [Projects](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betaProjects) for each team filled with [Subprojects](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/BetaSubprojects). These levels of organization are designed to help you give the right people access to the right collaborative spaces. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organizing your Work">
There are also  tools to keep track of your Resources and organize your work itself. There are [Resource Catalogs](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betaresourcecatalog), [Modules](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/betanetworks) (contain Networks) and [Pipelines](https://docs.artemisplatform.com/PipelinesIntro)
