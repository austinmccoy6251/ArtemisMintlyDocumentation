Folders are a great way to organize the Resources in your Catalog. There is nothing conceptually unique about how folders work in Artemis, but there are a few mechanics worth learning. This guide covers those mechanics. 
1.	Creating folders
2.	Remaining and deleting folders
3.	Moving Resources into folders
4.	Moving Resources out of folders
5.	Other rules about Folders

### Creating folders
Folders are created inside the Catalog by pressing the green new folder button, as seen below.

You can create folders inside folders (nesting limit is three). 

You can also create a Resource from inside a folder and it will automatically appear in there.

### Renaming and deleting folders
To rename or delete a folder first enter it then click its name near the top of your screen to expand a small menu, as seen below. 

Note you can NOT delete a folder until you’ve moved every Resource out of that folder. Continue reading to learn a quick and easy way to do so.

### Moving Resources into folders
You can move Resources into folders one by one or as groups. First, CTRL + Click the Resource(s) you want to move. When you do this, a button that says “Move Content” will appear. Press that button followed by the folder you want to move the Resources into.

This same process applies when moving Resources into subfolders (folders you created inside a folder).

### Moving Resources out of Folders
You can move Resources out of folders one by one or as groups. First, CTRL + Click the Resource(s) you want to move. Then click the “Move Content” button that appears at the top of your screen. Finally click the “Resource Catalog” icon at the top of your screen, as seen below.

### Other rules about folders
Here are some quick tips you may want to keep in mind: 
- Folders can be nested up to three times 
- You can move one folder into or out of another folder, even if the one being moved contains Resources
- Resources can be created from inside a folder, saving you the trouble of having to move it in
