title: "Adding New Status Tags"
description:
  "You can assign differed statuses to each instance in your archive."
---

We offer this feature so that teams can quickly share what status of development
different instances are. This is not mandatory and every organization that uses
Artemis will likely do it in a slightly different way.

For example, you may want to make an experimental branch of a project and
designate it as such for the rest of your team to see. This is where you can use
the "Exploratory" tag. If your team's workflow requires tags beyond those
Artemis comes pre-populated with you may create them in the general settings
tab.
