title: "Archive Overview"
description:
  "The resource catalog is where your team can record which resources are used
  in a given project. The instance archive is where you can track when and how
  each resource is deployed."

Every time a member of your team uses a resource in a project that is called an
"instance" of that resource and they should record it here. We provide a
framework to document the unique conditions of every instance, which other
instances it interacts with and how.

The Artemis network is automatically generated from the instance archive and the
interactions between instances documented there.

## Archives in Practice

This chart visualizes the relationship between resources and instances and shows
when you can create an instance directly versus when you need to first create
the underlying resource.
