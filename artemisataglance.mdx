## Artemis at a Glance
Artemis is a platform to document and diagram data science projects. We let individuals and teams keep track of every resource used in their projects, recording how and when they were employed.
This type of documentation is different from how you’d document software projects. When you’re documenting a software project you’re tracking the evolution of a single resource across multiple iterations. Data science projects, on the other hand, require you to document multiple discrete resources, how they evolve and the interplay between them. This requires a new structure, which we provide.
## Artemis Pillars 
Artemis lets you keep track of all the resources used in your projects in what we call a “resource catalog.” Then, we help you arrange them on interactive diagrams we call “networks” to create visual maps of your work. Each time a resource is placed on a network is called an “instance” of that resource. Artemis records the details of each instance and stores them in the “instance archive.” 
These are the three pillars of Artemis: The Resource Catalog, Network and Instance Archive.
This diagram models the interplay between these aspects of our system:
