title: "Artemis at a Glance"
---

Artemis is a platform to document and diagram data science projects. We let individuals and teams keep track of every resource used in their projects, recording how and when they were employed. 

This type of documentation is different from how you’d document software projects. When you’re documenting a software project you’re tracking the evolution of a single resource across multiple iterations. Data science projects, on the other hand, require you to document multiple discrete resources, how they evolve and the interplay between them. This requires a new structure, which we provide.

## Artemis Pillars 
Artemis lets you keep track of all the resources used in your projects in what we call a “resource catalog.” Then, we help you arrange them on interactive diagrams we call “networks” to create visual maps of your work. Each time a resource is placed on a network is called an “instance” of that resource. Artemis records the details of each instance and stores them in the “instance archive.” 

These are the three pillars of Artemis: The Resource Catalog, Network and Instance Archive.

This diagram models the interplay between these aspects of our system:

## Artemis Structure
Naturally, you’ll want to create multiple projects (networks and their accompanying resource catalogs and instance archives). If you’re inside a large organization you may also want to give different groups of people access to different projects while hiding what other groups are working on. Artemis lets you do that; you can create various workspaces inside your organization and each workspace can contain multiple projects.

## Getting Started
Doing is the best learning, so let’s jump right in. This guide will walk you through how to set up and run your first project. 
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create a workspace and project">
  The first thing we need to do here is make sure there are members in our organization. These people can subsequently be added to our first workspace. The way we add members to an org is by clicking the "Settings" tab on the left side toolbar, clicking "Users" when it appears then opting to "Add User."
    ![title](https://d27n7fycrsusaz.cloudfront.net/new+users.PNG)
    This will prompt us to add a user by their user ID. When someone gets an Artemis account they’ll be given an ID number – you need to get it from them and input it here to add them to your org.
    
Next, create a workspace by pressing the green “New Workspace” button on the home page. Name your workspace when prompted then click it when it appears. 
![title](https://d27n7fycrsusaz.cloudfront.net/add+workspace.PNG)
    Once inside the workspace go down to the “Users” tab and add new users. This time, you’ll see a prepopulated list of users that you’ve added to your org and you can select them by name.
    ![title](https://d27n7fycrsusaz.cloudfront.net/add+user+to+workspace.PNG)
    Finally, create a project inside your workspace, enter that project and add some users to it using the same procedure you used to add users to the workspace.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Create a few resources">
  Before you can place an instance of a resource on your network you need to create that resource in your team’s resource catalog. To do this, enter the project you’re working on and click the green “New Resource” button.
  ![title](https://d27n7fycrsusaz.cloudfront.net/new+resource+click.PNG)
  Clicking “New Resource” will make a window that looks like this appear. This is where you name the resource, designate what type (database, script, model, etc.) and optionally type a few notes about it. Note that you can choose a preloaded type or create your own custom types. 
![title](https://d27n7fycrsusaz.cloudfront.net/new+rec.PNG)
  After entering this basic info about the resource a second screen will pop up where you can record details about it. Usually the most salient details will be its location so your team can access it. Check out a full breakdown of everything you can record here.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Place a few instances on the network">
  Now we can pull over to our network. Do this by clicking the “Instance Network” button in your project. The network is blank but we’re going to populate it with instances of our resources. Each time a resource appears on a network, that’s an “instance” of that resource. 
  
  We make the distinction between instances because each instance deserves its own documentation. If a script is used to process data from XYZ database in one place but is also used to process data from ABC database in another place, we must kame a distinction between those two because they’re running under different conditions.
  
  Creating a new instance is easy. Simply toggle on “Edit Mode” at the top of the network and press the “New Instance” button. Your cursor will transform to a square outline. Clicking on the network will place an instance inside that outline. 
  
  Once you click to place an instance a modal like the one below will instantly appear. This is where you name the instance and select its underlying resource. The “underlying resource” is the resource you’re making an instance of. It’s important to note that you designate the underlying resource by pasting in its ID number. (It’s best to have two tabs open when you’re creating instances: one with your catalog to copy instance IDs from and one to build your network in.)
  
  After you’ve created more than two instances you can start drawing lines to document how they relate. Make sure “Edit Mode” is still toggled on then click two instances. A modal like the one below will appear where you can designate the relationships between the instances in question. For example, you may have a database and the script that created it. Fortunately, there are a limited number of ways resources can be related – check out this page for a rundown of what they are. 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Review instance archive ">
While the network is the easiest way to see all your instances at once you can also view them all in a catalog format in the “Insurance Archive.” The archive is visually similar to the resource catalog but displays all the instances you’ve created on your network.
