## Artemis at a Glance
Artemis is a platform to document and diagram data science projects. We let individuals and teams keep track of every resource used in their projects, recording how and when they were employed.
This type of documentation is different from how you’d document software projects. When you’re documenting a software project you’re tracking the evolution of a single resource across multiple iterations. Data science projects, on the other hand, require you to document multiple discrete resources, how they evolve and the interplay between them. This requires a new structure, which we provide.

## Artemis Pillars 
Artemis lets you keep track of all the resources used in your projects in what we call a “resource catalog.” Then, we help you arrange them on interactive diagrams we call “networks” to create visual maps of your work. Each time a resource is placed on a network is called an “instance” of that resource. Artemis records the details of each instance and stores them in the “instance archive.” 
These are the three pillars of Artemis: The Resource Catalog, Network and Instance Archive.
This diagram models the interplay between these aspects of our system:

## Artemis Structure
Naturally, you’ll want to create multiple projects (networks and their accompanying resource catalogs and instance archives). If you’re inside a large organization you may also want to give different groups of people access to different projects while hiding what other groups are working on. Artemis lets you do that; you can create various workspaces inside your organization and each workspace can contain multiple projects.

## Getting Started
Doing is the best learning, so let’s jump right in. This guide will walk you through how to set up and run your first project. 
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create a workspace and project">
  The first thing we need to do here is make sure there are members in our organization. These people can subsequently be added to our first workspace. The way we add members to an org is by clicking the "Settings" tab on the left side toolbar, clicking "Users" when it appears then opting to "Add User."
    ![title](https://d27n7fycrsusaz.cloudfront.net/new+users.PNG)
    This will prompt us to add a user by their user ID. When someone gets an Artemis account they’ll be given an ID number – you need to get it from them and input it here to add them to your org. 
Next, create a workspace by pressing the green “New Workspace” button on the home page. Name your workspace when prompted then click it when it appears.

    Once inside the workspace go down to the “Users” tab and add new users. This time, you’ll see a prepopulated list of users that you’ve added to your org and you can select them by name.

    Finally, create a project inside your workspace, enter that project and add some users to it using the same procedure you used to add users to the workspace.
