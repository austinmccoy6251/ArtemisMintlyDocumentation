Workspaces are like filing cabinets that store all your projects. Any group of
people in your org that need to collaborate around a set of projects can be
given their own workspace.

#### Name Your Workspace

This window will appear promoting you to name your space and add some basic
descriptive information. Many users use the "Description" box to post rules for
the space or the contact information of the manger in charge of it.

#### Adding Users

After you create your workspace you need to add users to it. Press the "Users"
button inside the space then use the green "Add Users" button. This will provide
the option to add users by their names or user IDs.
