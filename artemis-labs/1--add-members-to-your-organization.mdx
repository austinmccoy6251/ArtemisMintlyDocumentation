#### User IDs

Selecting the "Add User" button will open this window asking for the "User ID"
of the person you're trying to add to your organization. When a user creates
their Artemis login they're assigned a user ID, you must ask them what it is.
Inputting their ID will add them to your org making them available to add to
workspaces as well.
