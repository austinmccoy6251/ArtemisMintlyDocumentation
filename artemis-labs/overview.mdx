  "This guide will walk you through the entire process of getting started with
  Artemis from your first login to running your team's first project."

There are just five steps:

1. Add the first members to your organization
2. Create a workspace and add members to it
3. Create a project inside that workspace
4. Add your first resources to a catalog in the project
5. Document the first instances of those resources
6. View instances on the network

This might sound like a lot of steps but it only takes a few minutes. We walk
you through the entire process here:
