  with something they're working on and view how they relate."

#### Adding Users to your Project

Projects are **not** automatically accessible by all members of the workspace
they're nested inside. You must manually designate who can access it. **You can
only add people to your project who already belong both to your org _and_ the
workspace the board is inside.** Users may be added by name or ID after the
green button is pressed.
