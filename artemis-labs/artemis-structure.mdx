### Organizing with Artemis

Your organization can create as many "workspaces" as you'd like inside Artemis.
Each workspace can be shared with whatever combinations of staff you'd like and
serves as a filing cabinet for projects. Each project contains a resource
catalog, instance archive and network that illustrates the project.
