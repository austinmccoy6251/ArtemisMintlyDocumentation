Launching the network directly from the a project will display 2D map of all the
resource instances archived in your project. A 3D network is also available in
the settings menu that expands from the gear icon in the upper left hand corner

you to trace how data flows through your project and visualize dependency
relationships; learn more about those [here](/network/network-tools).
