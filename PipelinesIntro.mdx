Networks are great for collaborating with your team and laying out exploratory projects. 

However, if you try to use Networks to document pipelines (and every time you run them) you’ll be dissatisfied. It’s simply not practical to rebuild your project with new Instances every time you run it with new parameters. This is why we developed Artemis Pipelines.

We allow you to document the structure of your Pipeline then log every time you run it without manually rebuilding the entire thing.

This Pipelines Guide is broken down into three sections: 
1.	Constructing Pipelines 
2.	Running Pipelines? 
3.	Idk lol
